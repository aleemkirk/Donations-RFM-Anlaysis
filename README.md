# Background and Overview

A political party's ability to win elections is heavily dependant on donations and public support. This project analyzes the donation history of various political parties in the UK for the 2019 general election and uses the RFM model to categorize donors by evaluating three factors: recency of their last donation, frequency of all donations and monetary size of their donations. 

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:
- **Donation Trend Analysis** - Evaluation of donations over time, focusing on donor retention rates and donor behavior. 
- **Donor Segmentation Analysis** - Segmentation of donors into distinct groups based on recency, frequency and monetary (RFM) scores. 
- **Engagement and Fundraising Strategies** - Insights into potential fundraising initiatives to maximize donor support and minimize donor dropout rates (DDR).

The RFM model was applied to data from the previous 3 elections (2010-2019). Donors were segmented into 5 distinct groups:
- **Champions** - very active and donations tend to be large.
- **Potential Loyalists** - active donors which may have the potential to become champions
- **At Risk Customers** - donors which have contributed before but are relatively inactive. Previous donations may have been significant.
- **Can't Lose** - may have contributed before, but is now dormant. Previous donations may have been small.
- **Lost** - have not donated recently and previous donations were small.

# Recommendations

To encourage more contributions and donor activity, political nominees can utilize several targeted approaches in their engagement strategies:

1. Spend the majority of marketing and fundraising efforts on engaging individuals and companies that are potential loyalists, because they have the most potential of converting to champions in the future and are the most active donor types.  

2. Employ face-to-face or telephone marketing strategies to maximize donations from potential loyalists. 

3. Ramp up engagement efforts at the end of each quarter, since donors are more likely to give during these months. 

4. Spend more time investing in trade union relations and getting more engagement from trade unions. They have given the most donations since 2001 apart from individuals. However, their donations have been steadily declining since 2010.
