# Background and Overview

A political party's ability to win elections is heavily dependant on donations and public support. This project analyzes the donation history of various political parties in the UK. The RFM model was used to categorize donors by evaluating three factors: recency of their last donation, frequency of all donations and monetary size of their donations. 

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:
- Donation Trend Analysis - Evaluation of donations over time, focusing on donor retention rates and donor behaviour. 
- Donor Segmentation Analysis - Segmentation of donors into distinct groups based on recency, frequency and monetary (RFM) scores. 
- Engagement and Fundraising Stratergies - Insights into potential fundraising initiatives to maximize donor support.
